# Mox Data
**Mox-Data.com** is a cloud-based data ingestion tool used to process raw data for **Magic: the Gathering Online**. 

Players can upload and process raw data files created during online play. The processed data is then loaded and stored in a PostgreSQL database, after which users can clean and enhance their own records. Data is presented to the user in the form of tables and dashboards which help players track their results, evaluate their performance, and analyze their play patterns.

Head to the [**Getting Started**](https://mox-data.com/getting_started) page for step-by-step instructions showing you how to load, clean, and view your data.
# Goals
The first goal of the **Mox Data** project is to create a feature-rich replacement for the spreadsheets that many players use to track their match history by automating as much of the process as possible.

The second is to give players a whole new type of data to explore by generating a database of play-level records. Unlocking this method of examining player performance and playstyle will provide a new avenue for MTG statistical analysis, data-informed content, and decision-making.
